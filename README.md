# Acoustic-Scattering
Applications of the Kirchhoff Approximation method in 2D and 3D, Vectorised approach for 2D has also been produced. 
Undirected has been produced for both 2 and 3 dimensions whereas baffled piston source has only been produced for 2 Dimensions.

Things to do 
- Vectorise 3D
- Add the surface checker method in the vectorisation functions.
- Avoid hardcoding directivity patterns when it could be made as user input
